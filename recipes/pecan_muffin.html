    <p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup
        muffin tin.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine 1 cup all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, white sugar, brown
        sugar, pudding mix, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Beat milk,
        oil, and egg together in a separate bowl. Stir into flour mixture until
        combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Coat chocolate chips with 1 tablespoon flour and fold into the batter.
        Fold in pecans. Fill muffin cups 3/4 full of batter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into a muffin
        comes out clean, 18 to 20 minutes. Cool in the tin briefly before
        removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
      </li>
    </ol>
