    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Is there anything better together than cherry and chocolate? The assembly
      for these ice cream sandwiches is a bit challenging, but the flavor is
      totally worth it!

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Spritz a 11x17-inch
        baking pan with water; line with parchment paper. Grease parchment paper
        with cooking spray.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir brownie mix, vegetable oil, egg, and water together in a large
        bowl. Spread into the prepared pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center
        comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Let cool completely, at least 10
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make a shallow cut down the middle of the brownies using a knife or
        bench scraper. Make shallow cuts in each half to divide brownies into
        4x3-inch rectangles. Cover with plastic wrap and place in the freezer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Line two 9x13-inch rimmed baking sheets with aluminum foil and parchment
        paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place chocolate ice cream in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the
        paddle attachment. Blend on low speed until uniformly softened, 10 to 15
        seconds. Spread into one of the baking sheets.
      </li>
      <li>
        Clean out stand mixer bowl and dry. Add cherry chocolate ice cream.
        Blend on low speed until uniformly softened, 10 to 15 seconds. Spread in
        the second baking sheet. Cover both baking sheets with plastic wrap and
        freeze until firm, 8 hours to overnight.
      </li>
      <li>
        Slide 1 half of the brownies onto another baking sheet. Return 1 half to
        the freezer. Remove chocolate cherry ice cream form the freezer. Lift
        parchment paper with a spatula; slip your hand underneath and flip ice
        cream over the brownies. Peel off the parchment. Freeze for 2 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove chocolate ice cream and ice cream-covered brownies from the
        freezer. Lift parchment paper with a spatula to slip your hand
        underneath. Flip chocolate ice cream over cherry chocolate ice cream
        layer and peel off the larchment. Top with the brownie half. Freeze
        until firm, 5 hours to overnight.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove baking sheet from the freezer. Cut through shallow cuts with a
        sharp knife or bench scraper to make 6 ice cream sandwiches. Place 1
        sandwich into each sandwich bag; fold the edge and crease to seal. Place
        ice cream sandwiches in the freezer. Return baking sheet to the freezer
        for 1 hour.
      </li>
      <li>Repeat to make 6 more ice cream sandwiches. Freeze for 1 hour.</li>
      <li>
        Peel down bag as you eat, keeping the bag underneath to catch drips.
