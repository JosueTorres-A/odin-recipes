    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
      <li>1 cup warm water (110 degrees F / 45 degrees C)</li>
      <li>2 cups bread flour</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a small bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Let stand until creamy,
        about 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, combine 2 cups bread flour, olive oil, salt, white
        sugar and the yeast mixture; stir well to combine. Beat well until a
        stiff dough has formed. Cover and rise until doubled in volume, about 30
        minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn dough out onto a well floured surface. Form dough into a round and
        roll out into a pizza crust shape. Cover with your favorite sauce and
        toppings and bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 20
        minutes.
